# **University Projects**  

## **TTS**  

The program provides a variety of functions to interact with stock prices, including finding the latest price, calculating the average, identifying the lowest price and its corresponding day, determining the maximum single-day price change, and checking if any price exceeds a given threshold. Additionally, it includes a feature to suggest the best days to buy and sell for maximum profit. The user interface is built around a loop that continuously displays a menu of options and processes user input until they choose to exit.

## **Final Project**  

This Python script defines a `TextModel` class that analyzes textual data and classifies it based on linguistic features. It includes helper functions for cleaning text (`clean_text`), stemming words (`stem`), and comparing feature dictionaries (`compare_dictionaries`). The `TextModel` class stores features such as word frequency, word length distribution, sentence length distribution, stem frequency, and adjacent word pairs. It provides methods for adding text from strings and files, saving and loading model data, computing similarity scores, and classifying unknown text by comparing it to reference models. The script includes test functions to demonstrate text classification on sample data.

## **Calendar Dates**  

This code defines a `Date` class that represents calendar dates using day, month, and year attributes. It includes methods for checking leap years, determining the number of days in a month, copying a date, and finding the day of the week. Additional methods allow for advancing the date by one day, checking if one date is before or after another, and calculating the number of days between two dates. The class provides useful operations for manipulating and comparing dates effectively.

## **Connect Four**  

This project implements a Connect Four game using object-oriented programming in Python. The `Board` class handles game board operations, including adding and removing checkers, checking for wins, and resetting the board. The `Player` class represents a human player, while the `RandomPlayer` selects moves randomly. The `connect_four` function facilitates gameplay between two players, processing moves and determining the game outcome. Additionally, the `AIPlayer` class uses a lookahead strategy with different tiebreaking methods to make intelligent moves. The AI evaluates board states recursively, making strategic decisions based on potential future moves.
